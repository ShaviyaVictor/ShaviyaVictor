Hi 👋 My name is Victor Shaviya
===============================

Full Stack Dev
------------------

Switched careers mid 2021 when I joined Moringa School where I undertook a 6-months bootcamp for Software Development. I started off with HTML, CSS and JavaScript which then was taken a knot higher by the various front end frameworks including Angular and later on capped by diving into the back end part of software development(Python).
